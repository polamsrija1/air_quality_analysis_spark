# Air Quality Analysis - Section 1: Data Ingestion

## Project Objective
Build an end-to-end pipeline for air quality monitoring that:
- Ingests real-time sensor data (PM2.5, temperature, humidity)
- Processes and merges multiple data streams
- Performs quality checks and transformations
- Enables analysis and forecasting

## Section 1 Objective
Ingest and pre-process raw sensor data from TCP streams to create:
✔ Clean, timestamped records  
✔ Merged metrics per location-time  
✔ Validated output ready for analysis

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Install Java (Spark dependency)
```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk -y
```

# Verify installation
```bash
java -version
```
```bash
readlink -f $(which java)
```

# Set environment variables
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
```
```bash
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start TCP server (data producer)
python3 ingestion/tcp_log_file_streaming_server.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: Start Spark streaming (data processor)
python3 ingestion/structured_streaming_ingestion.py
```

## Issues Faced & Solutions

### Broken Pipe Errors
- **Cause**: Spark client disconnecting mid-stream
- **Fix**: Added proper JSON formatting and throttling in TCP server

### Missing Output Files
- **Cause**: Checkpoint directory conflicts
- **Fix**: Clear Output/ directory between test runs

### Java Not Found
- **Cause**: Incorrect JAVA_HOME path
- **Fix**: Verified path with `readlink -f $(which java)`

# Section-2: Data Aggregations, Transformations & Trend Analysis

## Objective
Enhance the pre-processed air quality dataset by applying:
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Normalization (Z-score scaling)
- Time-based aggregations (daily and hourly)
- Rolling averages, lag features, and trend indicators
- Saving final outputs as single CSV files for easy analysis

---

## Prerequisites

- Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Install Java (for Spark):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk -y
```

- Verify Java installation:
```bash
java -version
readlink -f $(which java)
```

- Set environment variables:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

---

## Commands to Run

- Run Section-2 processing script:
```bash
python3 section-2.py
```

- Outputs will be saved in the following locations:
  - `Output/Section2_enhanced_raw/`
  - `Output/Section2_daily_aggregation/`
  - `Output/Section2_hourly_aggregation/`

Each will contain **only one single CSV file**.

---

## Issues Faced & Solutions:

**1. Multiple Output Files Instead of One**
- **Issue**: Spark by default splits output into multiple `part-0000` files.
- **Fix**: Used `.coalesce(1)` before `.write()` to force saving as a single CSV.

**2. ApproxQuantile Error on avg_pm25**
- **Issue**: `avg_pm25` column was read as StringType instead of numeric.
- **Fix**: Explicitly casted `avg_pm25` to `DoubleType()` after reading the CSV.

**3. Lag Function AnalysisException**
- **Issue**: Error occurred while applying a custom window frame to `lag()`.
- **Fix**: Created a separate window without `.rowsBetween()` for the lag feature.

**4. Missing Temperature and Humidity Fields**
- **Issue**: Section-1 data did not include `temperature` and `humidity` columns.
- **Fix**: Generated random `temperature` (10°C–40°C) and `humidity` (20–90%) values using Spark's `rand()` function.

**5. Java Gateway Exit Error**
- **Issue**: Spark failed to start due to missing Java or unset `JAVA_HOME`.
- **Fix**: Installed Java 17, set the correct `JAVA_HOME` path, and updated the `PATH` variable.

# Section-3: Air Quality Analysis with Spark SQL
## Objective
Perform SQL-based analysis on the enhanced air quality dataset by:

Registering dataframes as temporary SQL views

Running SQL queries for key statistics and trends

Generating summarized outputs for reporting
## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Install Java (Spark dependency)
```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk -y
```

# Verify installation
```bash
java -version

## Commands to Run
# Run Section-3 SQL analysis script:
```bash
 python3 section-3.py
```
--> Outputs will be saved in the following location:
    Output/Section3_SQL_Results/
 --->Each SQL query result will be saved as a separate CSV file.

### Issues Faced & Solutions
# 1. File Not Found Error

***Issue: Path to enhanced Section-2 output CSV was incorrect.***

Fix: Double-checked the file path and ensured Section-2 was run before Section-3.

# 2. Java Gateway Exit Error

***Issue: Spark session failed to initialize due to missing Java.***

Fix: Installed Java and properly set JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables.

# 3. AnalysisException during SQL Queries

***Issue: Some columns had unexpected names or types.***

Fix: Explicitly casted columns where needed and validated schema using df.printSchema().
